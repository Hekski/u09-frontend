### The project

My goal of this assignment was to create a simplified Spotify interface that focuses on ease of use. The project should show the line of work from idea and concept to a complete application. The submission should demonstrate understanding of, application, and use of a RESTful API in node with JWT-based authentication with the MongoDB document database.
